# cssArt

<h2>Inspired by http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/css3-android-logo</h2>
<p> After watching some of these all I could think about was trying it out for
  myself, I had never known css could be used to create something so fun. I 
  had only ever thought of it as styling for pages and nothing else. For now
  it's just simple logos, but who knows what I'll be able to create in a few 
  years:)</p>
